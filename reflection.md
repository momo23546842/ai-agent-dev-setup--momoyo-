# Reflection

Software development has traditionally relied on developers manually writing code and designing logical structures on their own. The outcome of a project depended almost entirely on the developer’s technical expertise and ability to solve problems independently. However, with the rapid evolution of AI systems, the nature of software development is beginning to change. Instead of focusing solely on writing code, modern developers must learn how to collaborate with AI, communicate clearly with it, and integrate it into their workflow. This shift requires a new mindset—one where understanding how to direct AI becomes as important as understanding programming itself.

A key insight I gained during this session is that there are many different types of AI systems, and their ability to interact with external tools or files is heavily influenced by the Model Context Protocol (MCP). MCP plays an essential role in extending what AI can do by giving it structured access to external capabilities, such as GitHub repositories, calendars, or custom utilities. Through this, I realized that even someone like me, who is still a beginner in IT, can fully participate in development as long as I understand how AI works and how to instruct it effectively. The barrier to entry becomes lower when AI can handle complex tasks as long as I provide clear guidance.

One major shift in my understanding came from learning how MCP servers change the way I interact with AI tools. Until now, I had been using AI in a passive, assistant such as mainly asking questions, requesting explanations, or seeking help when I was not sure about something. AI was a tool I consulted, not a tool that took action. However, MCP completely changed that perspective. With MCP, AI can act more like an agent and  it can interact with files, access APIs, perform tasks, and operate external tools on my behalf. This makes AI more of an active collaborator rather than a passive helper. Learning even the basics of MCP showed me that AI is capable of far more than generating text. It can execute meaningful work when connected to external systems. This realization significantly transformed my understanding of what “using AI” really means.

Looking ahead to the remaining nine weeks of the program, I hope to develop the ability to use AI more actively and intentionally. I would like to learn how to guide AI systems in a way that produces the results I envision, and to build the skills needed to design effective instructions and workflows. My goal is to become confident in orchestrating AI agents so that they can support my development tasks, automate workflows, and collaborate with me in practical and productive ways. I also hope to gain more experience using MCP servers to integrate real tools into AI systems, so that I can eventually create AI-powered applications of my own. Ultimately, I want to reach a level where AI is not just something I use occasionally, but a core part of my daily development process.
